# WARNING
## This addon is VERY OLD and I no longer have time to support it. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. *I MEAN IT.*


Custom-ULX-Commands
===================

Place ONLY ONE of the included folders in your addons directory.   
customcommands_onecategory puts all the commands in one XGUI category called "Custom"
